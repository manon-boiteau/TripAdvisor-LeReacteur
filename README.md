## Welcome in my school exercice

Tripadvisor, Inc. is an American online travel company that operates a website and mobile app with user-generated content and a comparison shopping website. It also offers online hotel reservations and bookings for transportation, lodging, travel experiences, and restaurants.

### My work?

To code the frontend of a part of one page of TripAdvisor (see down below) with all the technics we saw in class, so as: flexbox, calc, media queries... There is no backend and no JavaScript for user interaction in this work.  
The difficulty here was to adapt the page for all the screen
